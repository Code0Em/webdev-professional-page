# Web Developer’s Professional Page

## Description

The aim of this project was to build a portfolio to showcase the developer’s work. The motivations for this included bolstering the developer’s public image and consolidating their deployed applications into a ‘one-stop-shop’ that is easily accessible to potential employers.

The project criteria included creating a page that displays the developer’s name, avatar and sections to portfolio their recent work and display their contact details. 

The specification for the portfolio section (called “Work”) was to include a larger image of the first project showcased in this section.

The page was also required to be responsive on various screens and devices.
